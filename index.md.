# PrintIQ

PrintIQ is a Python-based analytics tool that leverages the Etsy API v3 to fetch active listings in the “Digital Prints” category—collecting listing IDs, titles, prices, currency codes, and URLs—so designers and creators can analyze market trends, uncover high-potential niches, and spark ideas for original planners, trackers, and printables. All data is gathered strictly for research and insight generation under Etsy’s API terms; users retain full responsibility for ensuring any products they create respect intellectual property rights.
